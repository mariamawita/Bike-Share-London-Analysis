# Bike-Share-London-Analysis

The dataset contains 10 variables including the weather, holidays, and season of the year. The data contains numerical, categorical as well as boolean data fields described within the variables. The purpose of this analysis is to maximize resource utilization when Londoners use bike-sharing. This will be done by looking at usage frequency, bike avaiability, when they are more used etc.. First I transformed the categorical data points to factors (as.factor) and split the data to 70% training and 30% testing. Then I used linear Regression (Histogram, Box plot), Decision Tree and Random Forest to analyze the findings.
