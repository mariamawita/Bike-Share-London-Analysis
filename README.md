# Bike-Share-London-Analysis

There are 10 variables in the dataset including the weather, holidays, and season of the year. The data contains numerical, categorical as well as boolean data fields described within the variables. The purpose of this is maximizing resource utilization when Londoners use bike-sharing by looking at usage frequency, bike avaiability, when they are more used etc.. First we transform categorical data points to factors (as.factor) and split the data to 70% training and 30% testing. 
Then we use linear Regression (Histogram, Box plot), Decision Tree and Random Forest to analyze the findings.
